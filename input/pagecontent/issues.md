### Open Issues

- ToDo_001: Should we introduce a Trust Network Participant (TNP) actor that does the retreive and publish of keys and then make the VHL Sharer and VHL Receiver grouped actor with the TNP?

- ToDo_002: Can we use the same transaction to retrieve a single doc VHL as well as retrieve the docs in a folder VHL?

- ToDo_003: Do we want to talk about the general notion of a health link, and then both the verifiable and shared health links?  The SHL model has a different trust network assumption (no pre-cordination of sharer and receiver) so it may be cumbersome to take on in the first pass as the workflow is different?  

- ToDo_004: Some of the language has the QR code as synonymous with the VHL.  Should be careful in Vol 1 that QR is only an example of a type of a VHL that is used for low-bandwidth/contactless/access.  May be otheraccess mechanisms - bluetooth or NFC modalities are used in the future for the providing of a VHL by a VHL Holder to a VHL Receiver.   

- ToDo_005: Should we specify an API mechanism for the Publish PKI Material transaction?  It may be enought to treate them as Content Creator/Consumer pairs where the content is the location of a trustlist (as a DID).
